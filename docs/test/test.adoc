Introduction

{description}

AsciiDoc.py is a legacy processor for this syntax, handling an older
rendition of AsciiDoc. As such, this will not properly handle the
https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/technology.asciidoc[current AsciiDoc specification].
It is suggested that unless you specifically require the AsciiDoc.py
toolchain, you should find a processor that handles the modern AsciiDoc
syntax.

AsciiDoc.py is highly configurable: both the AsciiDoc source file syntax
and the backend output markups (which can be almost any type of
SGML/XML markup) can be customized and extended by the user.

AsciiDoc.py is free software and is licensed under the terms of the 'GNU
General Public License version 2' (GPLv2).
